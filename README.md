## üåü Overview Framework

![DLoRAL](figs/framework.png)


(a) Training procedure of PiSA-SR. During the training process, two LoRA modules are respectively optimized for pixel-level and semantic-level enhancement.

(b) Inference procedure of PiSA-SR. During the inference stage, users can use the default setting to reconstruct the high-quality image in one-step diffusion or adjust Œª<sub>pix</sub> and Œª<sub>sem</sub> to control the strengths of pixel-level and semantic-level enhancement.
